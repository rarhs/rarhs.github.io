  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><b>Effective date:</b> {{ "now" | date: "%Y-%m-%d" }}</p>

  <p>
    This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our mobile applications and related services
    (the “App”). If you have questions, contact us at <a href="mailto:alirezasagor@gmail.com">alirezasagor@gmail.com</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>We only collect the minimum data needed to operate and improve the App.</li>
    <li>We do not sell your personal information.</li>
    <li>If the App uses third‑party services (analytics, crash reporting, ads, payments), they may collect data as described below.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Information we collect</h2>

  <h3>Information you provide</h3>
  <p>
    If the App offers features like sign‑in, feedback forms, or support, you may provide information such as your name,
    email address, or the content of your messages. You can choose not to provide optional information.
  </p>

  <h3>Information collected automatically</h3>
  <p>
    The App may collect basic technical information to function correctly and to improve reliability, such as:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Device information (model, OS version, language)</li>
    <li>App version and settings</li>
    <li>Log data (timestamps, crash traces, performance diagnostics)</li>
    <li>Approximate location derived from IP address (if applicable)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How we use information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Provide and maintain the App</li>
    <li>Fix bugs and improve performance</li>
    <li>Respond to support requests</li>
    <li>Protect against fraud, abuse, and security incidents</li>
    <li>Comply with legal obligations</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Sharing of information</h2>
  <p>We may share information in the following limited situations:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>Service providers:</b> We may use trusted third‑party providers to operate the App (for example, hosting, analytics,
      crash reporting). They are permitted to process data only to provide services to us.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Legal requirements:</b> If required by law or to protect rights, safety, and security.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Business transfers:</b> If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, information may be transferred
      as part of that transaction.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Third‑party services</h2>
  <p>
    If the App integrates third‑party services (e.g., Google Play Services, analytics, crash reporting, ads, payments),
    those services may collect information according to their own privacy policies.
  </p>

  <h2>Data retention</h2>
  <p>
    We keep information only as long as needed for the purposes described in this policy, unless a longer retention period
    is required by law.
  </p>

  <h2>Security</h2>
  <p>
    We take reasonable measures to protect information, but no system is 100% secure. Please use the App at your own risk.
  </p>

  <h2>Children’s privacy</h2>
  <p>
    We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe a child has provided personal
    information, contact us and we will take appropriate steps to delete it.
  </p>

  <h2>Your choices</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You can uninstall the App at any time.</li>
    <li>Where available, you may be able to disable analytics or reset advertising identifiers in your device settings.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Changes to this policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will post the updated policy on this page and update the
    effective date.
